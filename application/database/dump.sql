Cordonnier gewonnen, maar vanwege een beschuldinging van plagiaat kwam het niet tot uitvoering. Ook pogingen tot renovatie van de oude beurs mislukten, waarna Berlage vanaf 1896 aan een nieuwbouwplan ging werken. Het imposante, langgerekte gebouw wordt geaccentueerd door in hoogte verspringende torenvormige volumes (trappenhuizen). De strakke bakstenen gevels hebben grote vensterreeksen.

Boven het met hardsteen beklede souterrain hebben de twee bouwlagen een gevelbekleding in zandsteen met kolossale corinthische pilasters. Het middenrisaliet wordt bekroond door een driehoekig fronton. De hoofdingang heeft men in 1904 verplaatst van de bel-etage (met stoep) naar het souterrain. Eveneens ontworpen door Philips Vingboons zijn de classicistische herenhuizen De Star (Kloveniersburgwal 77; 1650), gebouwd voor wolhandelaar Nicolaas Bambeeck, en De Ladder Jacobs (OZ Voorburgwal 316; 1655), gebouwd voor Pieter de Mayer bij diens suikerraffinaderij. Beide huizen worden bekroond door een fronton en hebben dorische pilasters bij de bel-etage en kolossale ionische pilasters bij de verdiepingen. Het vier travee&euml;n brede huis &lsquo;De Star&rsquo; is het resultaat van de samenvoeging van twee even brede bestaande panden. Hierdoor is de ingang uit het midden geplaatst en heeft de gevel tegen de regels in een pilaster in het midden (net als het huis Bartolotti). Tot de latere Vingboons-ontwerpen van herenhuizen met pilastergevels behoren Herengracht 386 (1663-\'65) en Herengracht 412 (1664-\'67). Bij het laatste is de zandstenen voorgevel uitgevoerd door steenhouwer Pieter Pietersz van Kuijck. Het huidige attiek met zoldervensters is begin 19de eeuw toegevoegd. Amsterdam, Herenhuis Kloveniersburgwal 95 Achter dit huis staat een groot tuinhuis in Lodewijk XIV-stijl (circa 1740). Het imposante Trippenhuis (Kloveniersburgwal 29) verrees in 1660-\'62 naar ontwerp van Justus Vingboons als dubbelhuis voor de broers Louis en Hendrick Trip, die in Zweden fortuin hadden gemaakt met ijzer- en kopermijnen, smederijen en geschutsgieterijen. De classicistische pilastergevel heeft boven het hoge en vlakke hardstenen basement (met ingangen) twee met zandsteen beklede verdiepingen en een mezzanino voorzien van gecanneleerde kolossale pilasters met corinthische kapitelen. De gevel is rijk gedecoreerd met ranken, bloemen, festoenen en putti. Het bekronend fronton van het middenrisaliet toont het wapenschild van de familie (drie trippen), omringd door kanonskogels en kanonslopen. De hoekschoorstenen hebben de vorm van mortieren (gereconstrueerd 1890). Het beeldhouwwerk is van Jan Gijseling sr. en Hendrick de Keyser de Jonge. Sinds 1814 huisvest het gebouw het Koninklijk Instituut van Wetenschappen, Letteren en Kunst (nu N.W.O.). Na een verbouwing door stadsbouwmeester Abraham van der Hart (1815-\'17) was een deel van het gebouw geschikt als Rijksmuseum van Schilderijen (collectie in 1885 naar Rijksmuseum). De toen ontstane samenvoeging van de voor- en achterzalen van beide huizen heeft men ongedaan gemaakt bij een restauratie in 1988-\'91. Vanwege de symmetrie van de gevel loopt de scheidingsmuur van de twee huisdelen in afgeschuinde vorm recht op Amsterdam, Trippenhuis het middelste venster aan. Er resteren nog veel originele interieuronderdelen, waaronder in de grote zaal van het linker deel een cassetteplafond met schilderingen van Nicolaas van Helt Stockade. Ook elders in het gebouw zijn plafondschilderingen van hem behouden. In de gangen van de beide delen bevinden zich bovendeurstukken van Allard van Everdingen.

Naast een hotel bevat het gebouw ook caf&eacute;-restaurant &lsquo;Americain&rsquo; en op de verdieping een feestzaal. Het in gele baksteen opgetrokken gebouw vertoont rationalistische elementen, jugendstil-details en verwijzingen naar Moorse en Venetiaanse architectuur. De tegeltableaus met voorstellingen van flora en fauna zijn vervaardigd door aardewerkfabriek &lsquo;De Distel&rsquo; naar ontwerp van L. Nienhuis. Kromhout ontwierp ook een deel van de inrichting, zoals de stoelen en de lampen. De gebrandschilderde ramen in de grote caf&eacute;zaal zijn uit de bouwtijd. In 1927-\'28 voegde G.J. Rutgers de vleugel aan de Leidsekade toe (beeldhouwwerk Th. Vos) en kreeg het caf&eacute; een inrichting in art d&eacute;co-stijl (lichtornamenten, J. Eisenloeffel) en zijn er wandschilderingen aangebracht. Er volgden nog een uitbreiding (1954) en een renovatie (1985-\'88). In opdracht van F. Schiller verrees het Hotel Schiller (Rembrandtplein 26-36; 1914-\'15, M.J.E. Lippits en N.H.W. Scholte) in Nieuw Historiserende stijl met neorenaissance- en rationalistische elementen. Op de begane grond bevindt zich het &lsquo;Caf&eacute; Schiller&rsquo;, trefpunt van artistiek Amsterdam. In 1950 heeft men het hotel gemoderniseerd, maar bij een restauratie (1977) is het toen verwijderde jugendstil-interieur van de Schillerbar hersteld. Het forse complex van het Carlton Hotel (Vijzelstraat 2-18; 1925-\'29, G.J. Rutgers) , tegenwoordig &lsquo;Jolly Hotel&rsquo;, vertoont een combinatie van expressionistische en rationalistische vormen. Karakteristiek is de galerij met betonnen pijlers bij de begane grond; de bakstenen gevels erboven zijn versierd met natuurstenen beeldhouwwerk (Th.A. Vos). Hotel IBIS (Stationsplein 49; 1988-\'92, J. Benthem en M. Crouwel) heeft een golvende gevel bestaande uit prefab-elementen met glazen bouwstenen.

Het betonskelet met afwisselend zware en lichte kolommen is bekleed met plastisch vorm gegeven bakstenen gevels. Het Scheepvaarthuis is rijk voorzien van bouwornamenten in smeedijzer, graniet en terracotta, verzorgd door H.A. van den Eijnde, H. Krop en W.C. Brouwer. Verder waren glazenier W. Bogtman en binnenhuisarchitect Th.W. Nieuwenhuis bij het project betrokken. Een uitbreiding kwam tot stand in 1926-\'28 (J.G. en A.D.N. van Gendt en J.M. van der Mey).

Andere verenigingen volgden, waaronder de Alg. Woningbouw Vereniging (1910), &lsquo;Eigen Haard&rsquo; (1910), &lsquo;Het Westen&rsquo; (1911) en &lsquo;Het Oosten&rsquo; (1912). Verder waren er de verenigingen &lsquo;Dr. Schaepman&rsquo; (1909; katholiek), &lsquo;Patrimonium&rsquo; (1911; protestant) en &lsquo;De Dageraad&rsquo; (1916; socialistisch). Voor de toenmalige &lsquo;Arbeidersco&ouml;peratie De Dageraad&rsquo; ontwierp J.W.F. Hartkamp samen met H.P. Berlage het woningblok Toldwarsstraat 107 (1907-\'08). Naar plannen van K.P.C. de Bazel kwamen de gesloten woningblokken De Kempenaerstraat e.o. (1914-\'18) en Zaandammerplein e.o. (1918-\'23) tot stand. Deze vallen op door het terugspringen van de hoeken. Kenmerkend is ook de Zaanhof (Zaanstraat 1-134; 1918, H.J.M. Walenkamp) met poortwoningen en gepleisterde gevelzones. Op initiatief van de wethouder voor volkshuisvesting F.M. Wibaut werd in 1915 de Gemeentelijke Woningdienst opgericht met A. Keppler als eerste directeur. Samen met de woningbouwverenigingen probeerde Keppler een programma voor woningwetwoningen van de grond te krijgen in een periode van sterk stijgende bouwkosten (die pas na 1920 weer afnamen). De rijkste uitingen van deze sociale woningbouw zijn uitgevoerd in een plastische expressionistische stijl, die vaak wordt aangeduid als de Amsterdamse School. Het exterieur van het bouwblok werd als &eacute;&eacute;n plastisch geheel gezien in plaats van een voortdurende herhaling van basisvormen. In zijn meest uitbundige vorm is dit zichtbaar bij het zogeheten Derde Blok aan het Spaarndammerplantsoen (1917-\'20), ook wel het &lsquo;Schip&rsquo; genoemd. Dit door M. de Klerk voor &lsquo;Eigen Haard&rsquo;  Amsterdam, Derde Blok Spaarndammerplantsoen ontworpen &lsquo;burchtachtige&rsquo; complex heeft aan de zijde van de Hembrugstraat (nrs. 257-305) een terugspringend gedeelte met plastisch siermetselwerk, tonvormige hoekerkers en als stedenbouwkundig accent een met dakpannen en daktegels beklede toren (gerenoveerd circa 1980). In opdracht van bouwondernemer K. Hille had De Klerk al het Eerste Blok (Spaarndammerplantsoen 68-138; 1913-\'15) getekend, wel gesloten maar nog iets rustiger van karakter. Aan de zuidzijde van het plantsoen verrees in 1915-\'16 voor &lsquo;Eigen Haard&rsquo; het Tweede Blok (Spaarndammerplantsoen 33-103) met opmerkelijk plastische ingangspartijen. Een bijzondere stedenbouwkundige samenhang heeft het in Plan-Zuid voor de &lsquo;De Dageraad&rsquo; in 1919-\'21 gebouwde complex met de P.L. Takstraat als centraal element en aan weerszijden woonblokken aan het Th. Schwartzeplein en het H. Ronnerplein (gerenoveerd 1983). Het ontwerp van M. de Klerk en P.L. Kramer voor dit project heeft als meest opvallende plastische elementen de blokvormig gelede wanden aan de beide pleinen - met schoorstenen en laddervensters als accenten - en de hoekoplossingen met naar boven toe terugwijkende golvende gevelvlakken op de hoeken van de P.L. Takstraat en de Burg. Tellegenstraat. Het beeldhouwwerk is van H. Krop. Aan de noordzijde wordt het complex afgesloten door het Co&ouml;peratiehof (1925-\'28, P.L. Kramer), gebouwd voor &lsquo;Onze Woning&rsquo;. Diverse andere volkswoningbouwprojecten kwamen tot stand naar expressionistische ontwerpen van J.C. van Epen; alle met kenmerkende erkervormige geledingen in de gevel. Zo ontwierp hij voor &lsquo;Rochdale&rsquo; het complex C. Krusemanstraat e.o. (1916-\'26), voor de &lsquo;Algemene Woningbouw Vereniging&rsquo; de blokken Willaertstraat 1-17 (1916-\'22) en Smaragdstraat e.o. (1922-\'24), en voor de &lsquo;Amsterdamse Co&ouml;peratieve Woningbouwvereniging Samenwerking&rsquo; de Harmoniehof e.o. (1919-\'22; in 1920-\'23 aangevuld met enkele dubbele villa\'s). Voor de laatstgenoemde woningbouwvereniging tekende Amsterdam, Tweede Blok Spaarndammerplantsoen J.F. Staal in plastische expressionistische stijl het blok J.M. Coenenstraat e.o. (1922-\'24). Veel traditioneler van vorm zijn ten slotte de huizen Kraaipanstraat e.o. (1920-\'24, J. Gratama en G. Versteeg) met hun kenmerkende &lsquo;open&rsquo; hoekoplossingen met trapgevels.',52.3896,4.87622,'Amsterdam','Noord-Holland','Spaarndammerplantsoen','17-204','1914',1914,NULL,'{\"blokken\": 1,

Aan de basis van dit gebouw staat de oprichting van een Commissie tot Stichting van een Museum Koning Willem I (1862). De eerste uitgeschreven prijsvraag (1863) leverde geen winnaar op, maar P.J.H. Cuypers werd tweede. Nadat de gemeente Amsterdam in 1873 had toegezegd haar schilderijenverzameling in bruikleen te geven, was er een uitgebreider ontwerp nodig. De daaropvolgende tweede prijsvraag (1875) werd wel gewonnen door Cuypers, die vervolgens &eacute;&eacute;n van zijn twee ingediende plannen uitwerkte tot het huidige gebouw. Dit tussen 1876 en 1885 verwezenlijkte museum kreeg een middenvleugel met onderdoorgang en aan weerszijden twee door vleugels omgeven binnenplaatsen. Aan de zuidwestkant bouwde men een bibliotheekuitbouw met ijzeren galerijen. De binnenplaatsen - voorzien van glazen kappen met vakwerkconstructies (sikkelspanten en trekstaven) - boden onderdak aan gipsafgietsels (westzijde) en de afdeling geschiedenis (oostzijde). Naast de overwelfde zalen van de begane grond werden kopie&euml;n gebouwd van onder meer de crypten van de kerken te Deventer en Maastricht.

In die tijd kwam het centrale, vierkante corps de logis tot stand, waarvan het middenrisaliet is voorzien van een fronton en een klok (Gerhard Schimmel, 1686). Aan weerszijden van de voorhof verrezen langgerekte zijvleugels, die oorspronkelijk met kwartronde colonnades waren verbonden met het corps de logis. Haaks op de zijvleugels werden dienstvleugels met hoekpaviljoens gebouwd. Nadat Willem III in 1689 ook koning van Engeland was geworden, liet hij in 1691-\'94 vier nieuwe paviljoens optrekken tussen het corps de logis en de zijvleugels. Daarin werden onder meer een nieuwe eetzaal, een schilderijengalerij en een kapel ondergebracht. De colonnades werden verplaatst om te dienen als afsluiting van de boventuin. Toen het paleis in 1807-\'09 als zomerverblijf werd ingericht voor Lodewijk Napoleon heeft men het geheel gepleisterd. Koning Willem III liet in 1875 aan de oostzijde een aanbouw met kunstzaal optrekken. Bij een verbouwing in 1911-\'14, naar plannen van rijksbouwmeester C.H.

Kort na het midden van die eeuw volgden de bouw van een dwarsschip en een recht gesloten koor, waardoor een romano-gotische kruiskerk ontstond. De topgevels zijn in de 17de eeuw verdwenen. In het begin van de 14de eeuw verlengde men het koor met een vijfzijdig gesloten, gotisch deel. In het derde kwart van de 15de eeuw kwam de huidige hallenkerk tot stand door de bouw van een noord- en een zuidbeuk. Kort daarna werd bij het koor de zuidkapel (Jozefkapel) gebouwd. De noordkapel (Mariakapel), met de aangebouwde  Appingedam, Herv. kerk en stadhuis, plattegrond sacristie en op de verdieping mogelijk een librije, kwam in het begin van de 16de eeuw tot stand. Rond dezelfde tijd sloopte men de oude westtoren. De kerk werd volgens een gevelsteen in 1561 hersteld, in 1594 van binnen wit gekalkt en in 1686 opnieuw hersteld na stormschade.

Omstreeks 1650 liet de Amsterdammer Cornelis de Graeff een huis met hofstede bouwen. Na diens dood kocht stadhouder Willem III het landhuis, waarna hij het in de jaren 1674-\'78 liet verbouwen tot jachtslot. Het ontwerp werd geleverd door stadhouderlijk architect Maurits Post. Het oude gebouw werd aan de achterzijde met een grote zaal en aan weerszijden met een vleugel vergroot. In de Franse tijd werd het door Lodewijk Napoleon geconfisceerd. Hij gaf J.Th. Thibault opdracht tot uitbreiding. In 1815 schonk de Staat het pand aan kroonprins Willem, de latere koning Willem II, wegens zijn verdiensten tijdens de slag bij Quatre Bras. In de periode 1816 tot 1822 werd het paleis op \'s lands kosten verbouwd en vergroot in neoclassicistische stijl, naar ontwerp van Jan de Greef en Zeger Reijers. Het bestaande gebouw werd wit gepleisterd en voorzien van een rond bordes en een hardstenen ingangspartij met balkon. Ook de vensters werden gemoderniseerd. De in het midden naar binnen buigende attiek, die oorspronkelijk alleen het middendeel bekroonde, werd nu over het gehele gebouw doorgetrokken. Op het dak werd met gebruikmaking van de oude schoorstenen een rechthoekig belv&eacute;d&egrave;re geconstrueerd. Aan weerszijden ontstonden nieuwe vertrekken met daarop aansluitend kwart-ronde vleugels tussen paviljoens. De vleugels met dorische zuilen waren oorspronkelijk open maar zijn later met glas gesloten. Inwendig verbouwde men onder meer de grote zaal tot een lagere zaal in empire-stijl met rijk gestucte lijsten en cassettentongewelf. Twee kamers in het oude gedeelte rechts van de hoofdingang werden samengetrokken en in 1819 door J.W.

In baksteen verrezen in 1383-\'90 ten oosten daarvan een dwarsschip en koor, waarvan alleen het dwarsschip over is met inwendig aanzetten voor - waarschijnlijk nooit uitgevoerde - stenen gewelven. In 1412 begon de bouw van een basilicaal schip met schijntriforium en op de zijbeuken aansluitende reeksen zijkapellen. Nadat in 1420 de houten noodkerk was weggebroken, kwam dit gotische schip in 1435 gereed. Onder leiding van Utrechtse Dombouwmeester Jacob van der Borch begon men in 1453 met de bouw van een gotische kooromgang met sacristie (en daarboven een librije). De sloop van het oude koor volgde in 1465. Op de fundamenten plaatste men natuurstenen zuilen met koolbladkapitelen om de door speklagen versierde koorlantaarn te dragen (inwendig met vensterbanktriforium). De kap en het houten tongewelf waren in 1471 gereed en nadat de stenen gewelven in de kooromgang waren geslagen, volgde in 1476 de wijding van het nieuwe koor. De lage kluis (met tralieramen) aan de zuidzijde is laat-15de-eeuws en in die tijd werd ook de vloer van het dwarsschip opgehoogd, waardoor de basementen van de vieringpijlers uit het zicht verdwenen. Rond 1485 trok men de zuiderzijbeuk langs de toren westwaarts door en aansluitend verrees daar een driezijdig gesloten doopkapel. Het noordtransept werd in 1510 uitgebreid met een Mariakapel. Anthonis Keldermans was ook betrokken bij de in navolging van de Oude Kerk geplande verlenging van het zuidtransept; maar dat werk kwam in 1512 niet verder dan de fundering. Na de kerkbrand van 1536 heeft men in 1540-\'49 de stenen gewelven en de scheidingen tussen de kapellen weggebroken en zijn de huidige zeer brede zijbeuken met houten tongewelven ontstaan. De portalen aan zuid- en noordzijde werden in 1546 en 1549 hersteld of vernieuwd; het torenportaal volgde in 1556. Herstellingen aan de kerk vonden verder plaats in 1655 (na de buskruitramp) en in 1837-\'41.',52.0123,4.3608,'Delft','Zuid-Holland','Markt','80','1396-1496 (toren)',1496,'Nieuwe Kerk (Delft)','{\"houten\": 4, \"weggebroken\": 2, \"1476\": 1, \"doopkapel\": 2, \"natuurstenen\": 1, \"1412\": 1, \"kruiskerk\": 1, \"leiding\": 1, \"door\": 2, \"werden\": 1, \"navolging\": 1, \"koolbladkapitelen\": 1, \"nooit\": 1, \"of\": 2, \"over\": 1, \"verschijning\": 1, \"het\": 9, \"om\": 1, \"verlenging\": 1, \"nadat\": 2, \"laat-15de-eeuws\": 1, \"1420\": 1, \"1540-\'49\": 1, \"opgehoogd\": 1, \"1485\": 1, \"zuidtransept\": 1, \"kap\": 1, \"op\": 3, \"ook\": 2, \"dombouwmeester\": 1, \"st.-ursulakerk\": 1, \"basementen\": 1, \"tralieramen\": 1, \"sloop\": 1, \"trok\": 1, \"alleen\": 1, \"aan\": 3, \"kluis\": 1, \"vieringpijlers\": 1, \"verrezen\": 1, \"-\": 2, \"1381\": 1, \"geslagen\": 1, \"1512\": 1, \"1510\": 1, \"baksteen\": 1, \"waarvan\": 1, \"begon\": 2, \"tongewelven\": 1, \"1383-\'90\": 1, \"gotische\": 2, \"vonden\": 1, \"ontstaan\": 1, \"lage\": 1, \"noordzijde\": 1, \"bij\": 1, \"oosten\": 1, \"der\": 1, \"1435\": 1, \"1453\": 1, \"huidige\": 1, \"aansluitend\": 1, \"schip\": 2, \"reeksen\": 1, \"zuiderzijbeuk\": 1, \"aanzetten\": 1, \"buskruitramp\": 1, \"koorlantaarn\": 1, \"versierde\": 1, \"schijntriforium\": 1, \"de\": 32, \"westwaarts\": 1, \"kerkbrand\": 1, \"driezijdig\": 1, \"wijding\": 1, \"zijbeuken\": 2, \"herstellingen\": 1, \"kapellen\": 1, \"anthonis\": 1, \"betrokken\": 1, \"plaatste\": 1, \"portalen\": 1, \"1465\": 1, \"kooromgang\": 3, \"oude\": 2, \"gesticht\": 1, \"vloer\": 1, \"h\": 1, \"dragen\": 1, \"waardoor\": 1, \"heeft\": 1, \"hersteld\": 1, \"na\": 2, \"fundamenten\": 1, \"1837-\'41\": 1, \"en\": 13, \"1471\": 1, \"stenen\": 3, \"zeer\": 2, \"ten\": 1, \"markt\": 1, \"maar\": 1, \"geplande\": 1, \"gesloten\": 1, \"verrees\": 1, \"te\": 1, \"kleine\": 1, \"kerk\": 4, \"nieuwe\": 3, \"werd\": 3, \"werk\": 1, \"noordtransept\": 1, \"aansluitende\": 1, \"langs\": 1, \"waren\": 2, \"herv\": 1, \"borch\": 1, \"voor\": 1, \"daarvan\": 1, \"80\": 1, \"daarboven\": 1, \"delft\": 1, \"brede\": 1, \"een\": 10, \"daar\": 1, \"bouw\": 2, \"jacob\": 1, \"driebeukige\": 1, \"dat\": 1, \"gereed\": 2, \"uit\": 1, \"maagd\": 1, \"dan\": 1, \"1655\": 1, \"zuid-\": 1, \"speklagen\": 1, \"waarschijnlijk\": 1, \"zuilen\": 1, \"1556\": 1, \"tijd\": 1, \"vensterbanktriforium\": 1, \"kwam\": 2, \"van\": 13, \"fundering\": 1, \"plaats\": 2, \"basilicale\": 1, \"dwarsschip\": 3, \"zijn\": 1, \"miraculeuze\": 1, \"basilicaal\": 1, \"verdwenen\": 1, \"was\": 2, \"1549\": 1, \"tussen\": 1, \"rond\": 1, \"met\": 10, \"koor\": 3, \"uitgebreid\": 1, \"zicht\": 1, \"dit\": 1, \"die\": 1, \"volgde\": 3, \"noodkerk\": 1, \"verder\": 2, \"men\": 4, \"1546\": 1, \"zuidzijde\": 1, \"is\": 3, \"scheidingen\": 1, \"sacristie\": 1, \"librije\": 1, \"toren\": 2, \"uitgevoerde\": 1, \"tongewelf\": 1, \"in\": 20, \"niet\": 1, \"keldermans\": 1, \"rijzige\": 1, \"inwendig\": 2, \"gewelven\": 3, \"utrechtse\": 1, \"vernieuwd\": 1, \"torenportaal\": 1, \"onder\": 1, \"1536\": 1, \"mariakapel\": 1, \"zijkapellen\": 1}'),(12029,23,'Prinsenhof',NULL,52.0126,4.35494,'Delft','Zuid-Holland','Oude Delft','1-185','ca. 1400 (gesticht)',1400,'Prinsenhof (Delft)','{\"prinsenhof\": 1, \"null\": 1, \"delft\": 1}'),(12556,26,'Stadhuis',NULL,52.2514,6.15578,'Deventer','Overijssel','Grote Kerkhof','4',NULL,NULL,NULL,'{\"stadhuis\": 1, \"deventer\": 1, \"null\": 1}'),(12572,25,'Grote of St. Lebuïnuskerk','De (Herv.) Grote of St.-Lebu&iuml;nuskerk (Grote Kerkhof 42) is een ruime laatgotische hallenkerk met kooromgang en een romaanse crypte; de forse toren heeft twee geledingen en een achtkantige lantaarn. Noch van het kerkje dat omstreeks 770 door Lebu&iuml;nus werd gesticht, noch van de beide kerkjes van kort na 775 en na 881 zijn sporen teruggevonden. De kern van het huidige gebouw is een zeer grote vroegromaanse kapittelkerk die kort na 1046 door de Utrechtse bisschop Bernold werd gesticht. Deze niet-overwelfde basiliek - geheel gebouwd in tufsteen - kwam in &eacute;&eacute;n bouwfase tot stand. Ze bestond uit een oostelijk dwarsschip en koor met een gedeeltelijk verzonken crypte, waarboven een hoogkoor was, aan beide zijden geflankeerd door een zijkoor. Aan de westzijde bevond zich eveneens een dwarsschip met daartegen aangebouwd een westwerk bestaande uit twee romaanse westtorens, aan beide zijden geflankeerd door lagere traptorens. Tussen beide torens zal zich een lage ingangshal hebben bevonden, waarboven een ruimte was met uitzicht op het schip. Tijdens opgravingen in 1961-\'62 zijn hiervan de funderingen blootgelegd. Over de juiste reconstructie van dit westwerk verschillen de meningen en dat geldt ook voor de interpretatie van de functie, waarbij vergelijkingen zijn gemaakt met zowel de Dom van Verdun als de St.-Gertrudiskerk te Nijvel. Het basilicale schip zou naar de huidige inzichten oorspronkelijk een indeling hebben gekend met zes scheibogen ondersteund door vijf rode zandstenen zuilen, zoals die nu nog te vinden zijn in de eveneens door Bernold gestichte kleinere, maar verder zeer vergelijkbare, St.-Pieterskerk te Utrecht. Meer is bekend over de lichtbeuk, waarvan resten boven de huidige gewelven bewaard zijn gebleven en op grond waarvan aan beide zijden acht rondboogvensters gereconstrueerd kunnen worden. Ook de noordwand van het westelijke dwarsschip, waarin zich een toegang naar het bisschopshof bevond, de bijbehorende oostelijke kruispijlers, evenals de noordwand van het oostelijke dwarsschip en de vier kruispijlers zijn bewaard gebleven. Het veruit belangrijkste 11de-eeuwse restant is evenwel de crypte. De ribloze kruisgewelven van de crypte worden gedragen door twee rijen van elk drie zuilen. De zuilen hebben teerlingkapitelen en spiraalvormig gegroefde of geschubde schachten uit Nivelsteiner zandsteen. De absis van de crypte, waarin een 11de-eeuws venster zit, is inwendig halfrond en uitwendig driezijdig gesloten. Toegang tot de crypte had men vanuit de lage zijkoren, waarvan de vloerhoogte ongeveer overeenkomt met het bordes van de huidige toegangstrap. In de crypte bevindt zich nog een put die in verbinding staat met de IJssel, enkele nissen en een later altaar. De muurschilderingen in de crypte, met een voorstelling van de vier aartsengelen die de Arma Christi dragen, stammen uit de 15de eeuw en mogelijk van kort na 1468.',52.252,6.15522,'Deventer','Overijssel','Grote Kerkhof','42',NULL,NULL,'Grote of Lebuïnuskerk','{\"bevonden\": 1, \"verdun\": 1, \"dom\": 1, \"bewaard\": 2, \"toegangstrap\": 1, \"ruime\": 1, \"rijen\": 1, \"st.-lebu&iuml\": 1, \"over\": 2, \"42\": 1, \"voorstelling\": 1, \"enkele\": 1, \"kerkje\": 1, \"grond\": 1, \"funderingen\": 1, \"gebouwd\": 1, \"gereconstrueerd\": 1, \"uitzicht\": 1, \"1961-\'62\": 1, \"meer\": 1, \"-\": 2, \"aangebouwd\": 1, \"blootgelegd\": 1, \"st.-gertrudiskerk\": 1, \"kort\": 3, \"lage\": 2, \"vier\": 2, \"huidige\": 4, \"kerkjes\": 1, \"indeling\": 1, \"westwerk\": 2, \"laatgotische\": 1, \"drie\": 1, \"eeuw\": 1, \"tijdens\": 1, \"de\": 38, \"kunnen\": 1, \"nuskerk\": 1, \"twee\": 3, \"verschillen\": 1, \"gedeeltelijk\": 1, \"bisschop\": 1, \"hebben\": 3, \"vanuit\": 1, \"bernold\": 2, \"juiste\": 1, \"ribloze\": 1, \"1468\": 1, \"worden\": 2, \"belangrijkste\": 1, \"zijkoor\": 1, \"stammen\": 1, \"later\": 1, \"n\": 1, \"functie\": 1, \"vergelijkbare\": 1, \"gegroefde\": 1, \"gesticht\": 2, \"heeft\": 1, \"teruggevonden\": 1, \"zes\": 1, \"sporen\": 1, \"oorspronkelijk\": 1, \"zandstenen\": 1, \"nus\": 1, \"basiliek\": 1, \"en\": 11, \"gekend\": 1, \"lebu&iuml\": 1, \"utrecht\": 1, \"crypte\": 8, \"noordwand\": 2, \"zeer\": 2, \"hallenkerk\": 1, \"gebouw\": 1, \"geflankeerd\": 2, \"kern\": 1, \"lichtbeuk\": 1, \"waarin\": 2, \"tufsteen\": 1, \"te\": 3, \"bijbehorende\": 1, \"zijkoren\": 1, \"kruisgewelven\": 1, \"voor\": 1, \"st\": 1, \"bevindt\": 1, \"had\": 1, \"schachten\": 1, \"westtorens\": 1, \"een\": 18, \"overeenkomt\": 1, \"hoogkoor\": 1, \"dat\": 2, \"omstreeks\": 1, \"westzijde\": 1, \"gedragen\": 1, \"beide\": 5, \"restant\": 1, \"van\": 15, \"basilicale\": 1, \"bekend\": 1, \"verbinding\": 1, \"zijden\": 3, \"met\": 9, \"tussen\": 1, \"zich\": 4, \"tot\": 2, \"geldt\": 1, \"koor\": 1, \"als\": 1, \"verder\": 1, \"men\": 1, \"zoals\": 1, \"spiraalvormig\": 1, \"acht\": 1, \"opgravingen\": 1, \"gestichte\": 1, \"romaanse\": 2, \"gewelven\": 1, \"muurschilderingen\": 1, \"stand\": 1, \"zal\": 1, \"vloerhoogte\": 1, \"utrechtse\": 1, \"traptorens\": 1, \"gebleven\": 2, \"uitwendig\": 1, \"nu\": 1, \"veruit\": 1, \"resten\": 1, \"geheel\": 1, \"rondboogvensters\": 1, \"door\": 7, \"evenals\": 1, \"deventer\": 1, \"kleinere\": 1, \"rode\": 1, \"of\": 3, \"bestond\": 1, \"het\": 9, \"gemaakt\": 1, \"ingangshal\": 1, \"bordes\": 1, \"881\": 1, \"11de-eeuws\": 1, \"forse\": 1, \"op\": 2, \"nog\": 2, \"ook\": 2, \"elk\": 1, \"&eacute\": 2, \"aan\": 4, \"waarbij\": 1, \"teerlingkapitelen\": 1, \"zou\": 1, \"nijvel\": 1, \"evenwel\": 1, \"waarvan\": 3, \"kerkhof\": 1, \"verzonken\": 1, \"lantaarn\": 1, \"christi\": 1, \"eveneens\": 2, \"put\": 1, \"oostelijk\": 1, \"schip\": 2, \"naar\": 2, \"zowel\": 1, \"bouwfase\": 1, \"interpretatie\": 1, \"reconstructie\": 1, \"absis\": 1, \"ijssel\": 1, \"driezijdig\": 1, \"niet-overwelfde\": 1, \"waarboven\": 2, \"bisschopshof\": 1, \"halfrond\": 1, \"vroegromaanse\": 1, \"kruispijlers\": 2, \"geledingen\": 1, \"11de-eeuwse\": 1, \"bevond\": 2, \"15de\": 1, \"kooromgang\": 1, \"staat\": 1, \"boven\": 1, \"nivelsteiner\": 1, \"meningen\": 1, \"dragen\": 1, \"noch\": 2, \"altaar\": 1, \"na\": 4, \"mogelijk\": 1, \"scheibogen\": 1, \"ongeveer\": 1, \"ondersteund\": 1, \"zandsteen\": 1, \"bestaande\": 1, \"maar\": 1, \"gesloten\": 1, \"1046\": 1, \"achtkantige\": 1, \"werd\": 2, \"lagere\": 1, \"herv\": 1, \"deze\": 1, \"770\": 1, \"toegang\": 2, \"775\": 1, \"vijf\": 1, \"hiervan\": 1, \"uit\": 4, \"zuilen\": 3, \"kwam\": 1, \"geschubde\": 1, \"st.-pieterskerk\": 1, \"ze\": 1, \"dwarsschip\": 4, \"westelijke\": 1, \"arma\": 1, \"lebuïnuskerk\": 1, \"zijn\": 6, \"was\": 2, \"grote\": 4, \"daartegen\": 1, \"dit\": 1, \"die\": 4, \"vinden\": 1, \"is\": 5, \"vergelijkingen\": 1, \"zit\": 1, \"ruimte\": 1, \"oostelijke\": 2, \"toren\": 1, \"nissen\": 1, \"in\": 7, \"inwendig\": 1, \"kapittelkerk\": 1, \"venster\": 1, \"aartsengelen\": 1, \"torens\": 1, \"inzichten\": 1}'),(13417,27,'Grote Kerk','De (Herv.)

De voorgevel met balkon en hoekrisalieten is in Bentheimer zandsteen uitgevoerd. Dit in de strakke stijl van het classicisme uitgevoerde stadhuis kwam in 1686-\'94 tot stand naar plannen van Steven Vennecool ter vervanging van een voorganger uit 1460. De beelden op de attiek (Wijs Beleid en Eendrachtig Bestuur) en de stedenmaagden aan weerszijden van het balkon zijn gemaakt door Pieter van der Plasse. Een cartouche boven het balkon meldt het devies van Enkhuizen: &lsquo;Candide et Constanter&rsquo; (oprecht en standvastig). Het v&oacute;&oacute;r de voorgevel opgestelde kanon (1551) werd in 1622 buitgemaakt op Duinkerker kapers; het verhaal daarvan staat op een gevelbord met gesneden omlijsting (1661; gedicht Joost van den Vondel). Binnen leidt de lage Blauwe Zaal (hardstenen vloer) via een trap naar de ruime en hoge Witte Zaal of Burgerzaal (met marmeren vloer), die in spaarvelden is voorzien van grisailles (Dirck Ferreris). Verder heeft deze ruimte zes armvormige houten luchters. De toegang tot de Burgemeesterskamer is een houten dorisch poortje met bovendeurstuk &lsquo;Triomf van de Vrede&rsquo; (Ferreris). Een geschilderd behangsel toont een allegorie op het Romeinse bestuur (1707, gerestaureerd 1903), ontworpen door Romeyn de Hooghe en uitgevoerd door diens leerlingen. Verder zijn hier een plafondschildering voorstellend &lsquo;Kracht en Liefde&rsquo; (Ferreris) en een schouw met een kort na 1801 aangebracht 17de-eeuws schoorsteenstuk met als thema Charitas (Theodoor van Tulden). De Vroedschapskamer heeft een wandbekleding van rode velours d\'Utrecht. De drie plafondschilderingen (paalkistrecht, Gerechtigheid en visvangst) zijn evenals het schoorsteenstuk (Wijsheid) gemaakt door Ferreris. Ook de Schepenkamer (nu trouwzaal) heeft een (groene) velours d\'Utrecht-bekleding (gerestaureerd 1902). Wederom van Ferreris zijn de plafondschildering (Rede en Waarheid) en het schoorsteenstuk (Justitia). De Weeskamer bevat een marmeren schoorsteenmantel in Lodewijk XV-vormen (Asmus Frauen), een schoorsteenstuk uit 1692 (Barmhartigheid; Johan van Neck) en wandtapijten met arcadische landschappen en allegorische verwijzingen naar de verzorging van wezen (1710, Alexander Baert). Twee andere vertrekken hebben elk nog een schoorsteenstuk van Johan van Neck.

Beide topgevels hebben een gedraaide toppinakel, die tevens als schoorsteenkanaal dient. De topgevel aan de zuidzijde is door een latere aanbouw grotendeels uit het zicht geraakt; hier bevindt zich nog wel een zonnewijzer uit 1615. Aan de oostzijde staat de Schepentoren, met een vierkante onderbouw, een omgang met kantelen en een achtzijdige bovenbouw bekroond met een zandstenen balustrade en een opengewerkte uivormige spits. Het gebouw gaat terug tot het midden van de 14de eeuw, maar na een felle brand in 1543 heeft men bij het herstel renaissance-elementen aan het gebouw toegevoegd. Van dit herstel dateren onder meer de overkragende, opengewerkte balustrade langs de dakranden en de balustrade van de Schepentoren. Twee verdiepingsvensters, het ene aan de voorzijde en het andere aan de achterzijde, hebben gesmede vensterkorven. Het gebouw heeft een souterrain met kruisgewelven. De bel-etage was vroeger toegankelijk via een bordestrap en deur in het midden van de voorgevel, maar deze zijn weggehaald bij de laat-19de-eeuwse restauratie. Naar plannen van P.J.H. Cuypers werden in 1894-1901 de noord- en de westgevel en in 1913-\'15 de oostgevel en de Schepentoren aangepakt. De 15de-eeuwse beelden van de voorgevel verving men in 1933-\'38 door nieuwe exemplaren van J. Polet. Net als de voorgangers stellen zij voor: Karel de Grote, Alexander de Grote, de Matigheid, de Trouw, de Gerechtigheid en de Barmhartigheid. De baldakijnen boven de beelden dateren van de restauratie.

Het Graanmagazijn der Armen (Oude Rijn 44-46) werd in 1754 (gevelsteen) gebouwd als een dubbel pakhuis ter plaatse van het 15de-eeuwse Huiszittenhuis. Het links aangrenzende pand Oude Rijn 42 diende tot 1870 als broodbakkerij. In 1988 heeft men het complex verbouwd tot studentenhuisvesting. Een vergelijkbare brede afgeknotte topgevel als Oude Rijn 44 bezit het tot woonhuis verbouwde pakhuis Nieuwstraat 31a (circa 1700). Uit het midden van de 19de eeuw dateren de in sobere neoclassicistische vormen gebouwde pakhuizen Oude Rijn 36, met in de kroonlijst een olifantje op een console, en Lange Mare 60. Het pakhuis Nieuwstraat 43 uit 1863 heeft drie pakhuisdeuren boven elkaar. Het voorm. pakhuis Nieuwe Rijn 71 (circa 1870) kreeg gepleisterde lisenen en daklijst in de stijl van J.W. Schaap en het voorm. graanpakhuis Nieuwstraat 32 (circa 1875) is uitgevoerd in eclectische stijl. Iets jonger is het pakhuis Oude Rijn 89 uit 1904. Windmolens.

Als houtzaagmolen ingericht zijn de molens De Heesterboom (Haagweg 57) uit 1804 (gerestaureerd 1994) en De Herder (Haarlemmerweg 80), die in 1884 vanuit Amsterdam naar hier is overgebracht. Beide zijn stellingmolens met een houten onderbouw, een met riet gedekte achtzijdige romp en twee lage houten zijvleugels.

Het kleine, beschadigde medaillon in het midden stelt vermoedelijk Philips II voor, die in 1550 enige tijd in het gebouw verbleef.',50.8484,5.68877,'Maastricht','Limburg','Vrijthof','18','eerste helft 16e eeuw e.v.',1600,'Spaans Gouvernement','{\"nu\": 2, \"tekststenen\": 1, \"fraybart\": 1, \"iii\": 1, \"behuizing\": 1, \"laat-gotische\": 1, \"habsburg\": 1, \"landvoogdes\": 1, \"gestileerde\": 1, \"1520\": 1, \"gekroonde\": 1, \"het\": 15, \"aangebracht\": 1, \"deel\": 1, \"plus\": 1, \"nog\": 1, \"op\": 2, \"versierd\": 1, \"binnenplaats\": 1, \"museum\": 2, \"aan\": 5, \"maria\": 2, \"oultre&rsquo\": 1, \"johannes\": 1, \"vakwerk\": 1, \"hier\": 1, \"servaaskapittel\": 1, \"bij\": 2, \"rechter\": 1, \"rondbogen\": 1, \"maskers\": 1, \"naar\": 1, \"spreuk\": 1, \"habsburgse\": 1, \"voorzien\": 2, \"haar\": 1, \"&lsquo\": 1, \"18\": 1, \"balusterzuilen\": 1, \"zuster\": 1, \"verdieping\": 1, \"drie\": 1, \"hertogin\": 1, \"de\": 16, \"karel\": 3, \"triomfboogversiering\": 1, \"bezoek\": 1, \"gevel\": 1, \"hun\": 1, \"huis\": 1, \"medaillonportretten\": 1, \"doorgang\": 1, \"1397\": 1, \"v\": 3, \"gouvernement\": 3, \"oorspronkelijk\": 1, \"en\": 6, \"keizerskroon\": 1, \"arcade\": 1, \"vensters\": 2, \"stad\": 1, \"herculeszuilen\": 1, \"banderol\": 1, \"gebouw\": 1, \"verblijven\": 1, \"stond\": 1, \"vrijthof\": 2, \"boogvelden\": 1, \"kleine\": 1, \"hij\": 1, \"mergelsteen\": 1, \"medaillon\": 1, \"opvolgers\": 1, \"werd\": 2, \"vermoedelijk\": 1, \"voor\": 3, \"jan\": 1, \"johanna\": 1, \"castili&euml\": 1, \"een\": 3, \"kreeg\": 1, \"kapitelen\": 1, \"wapen\": 1, \"kanunnik\": 1, \"vijf\": 1, \"verbleef\": 1, \"1545-\'46\": 1, \"beschadigde\": 1, \"proost\": 1, \"monsterdieren\": 1, \"vader\": 1, \"keizerlijke\": 1, \"dat\": 1, \"borst\": 1, \"uit\": 1, \"adelaar\": 1, \"maastricht\": 1, \"tijd\": 1, \"stelt\": 1, \"middenvenster\": 1, \"konden\": 1, \"kwam\": 1, \"st.-servaaskapittel\": 1, \"1333\": 1, \"ter\": 1, \"herbouwd\": 1, \"beding\": 1, \"van\": 13, \"1550\": 1, \"hertog\": 1, \"philips\": 2, \"verwijzen\": 1, \"midden\": 1, \"schone\": 1, \"gedeelde\": 1, \"zijn\": 2, \"bezoeken\": 1, \"enige\": 1, \"tussen\": 1, \"schonk\": 1, \"met\": 7, \"voort\": 1, \"vroege\": 1, \"hongarije\": 2, \"als\": 1, \"die\": 1, \"brabantse\": 1, \"verder\": 1, \"voorm\": 1, \"gedecoreerd\": 1, \"pand\": 1, \"keizer\": 2, \"spaans\": 3, \"is\": 1, \"ii\": 1, \"uitgevoerde\": 1, \"in\": 10, \"verblijf\": 1, \"gelegenheid\": 1, \"renaissance-stijl\": 1, \"onder\": 1, \"af\": 1}'),(27997,65,'Helpoort',NULL,50.8456,5.69452,'Maastricht','Limburg','N.v.t.',NULL,'1229',1229,'Helpoort (Maastricht)','{\"maastricht\": 1, \"helpoort\": 1, \"null\": 1}'),(29376,69,'Oostkerk',NULL,51.5027,3.62063,'Middelburg','Zeeland','Oostkerkplein','1',NULL,NULL,NULL,'{\"oostkerk\": 1, \"middelburg\": 1, \"null\": 1}'),(29949,71,'Boerderij aan de Zandstraat 5',NULL,51.5532,5.21266,'Moergestel','Noord-Brabant','Zandstraat','5','vroeg 19e eeuw',1900,'Zandstraat 5','{\"de\": 1, \"zandstraat\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"moergestel\": 1, \"aan\": 1, \"boerderij\": 1, \"null\": 1}'),(31938,72,'Basiliek van de H.H.

In het eerste kwart van de 16de eeuw werd de grotendeels in mergel uitgevoerde zuidbeuk toegevoegd en werd de westgevel vernieuwd. Nicolaas van Breyll liet in 1651 beide beuken verhogen en de bakstenen trapgevels aan de koorzijde optrekken. De twee mergelstenen cartouches in de zuidelijke trapgevel tonen de wapens van Nicolaas van Breyll en pastoor Nicolaus Nagel.

Thibalt van Voeren liet hier rond 1087 een eerste versterking aanleggen in de vorm van een rechthoekige donjon, waarvan de bouw rond 1115 werd voortgezet door zijn opvolger Gosewijn I van Heinsberg. Deze donjon werd al in 1122 verwoest en vervolgens rond 1170 herbouwd in een zestienhoekige vorm. Na de verwoesting van dit bouwwerk in 1214 volgde de bouw van een kleinere tienhoekige don-jon. Toen verrees ook een oostvleugel ter plaatse van de huidige onderbouw van de ridderzaal. De derde donjon maakte in de tweede helft van de 13de eeuw plaats voor een zuidvleugel in opdracht van Diederik II van Kleef of zijn zoon Walram. Gelijktijdig begon men met het uithakken van de dwingel (Van Meijlandstraat) - een verdedigbare toegangsweg - waardoor men de Heunsberg van het plateau van Margraten scheidde wat de hoogteburcht beter verdedigbaar maakte. Toch werd de burcht in 1329 opnieuw verwoest. Deze werd door Diederik IV in gotische stijl herbouwd tot een fors L-vormig complex met een kleine traptoren in de binnenhoek, een ridderzaal (oostzijde) en een kapel (noordzijde). Verdere uitbreidingen en versterkingen volgden in de 15de eeuw; zo werd de dwingel in 1464-\'65 verder uitgediept.

Op basis van het toenmalige fabricageproces ontstond een complex met fabrieksdelen voor tabak (achtlaags), koffie (vijflaags) en thee (drielaags) en aan de voorzijde een concaaf kantoorgebouw met haakse vleugel. Luchtbruggen verbinden het kantoorgebouw en het pakhuis aan de Schie-zijde met de tabaksfabriek, die wordt bekroond door een rond uitzichtspaviljoen.
